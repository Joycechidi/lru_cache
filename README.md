# Lease Recently Used (LRU) Cache Implementation in Python
This program contains pythoon code for various classes, functions and methods that implement various operations in the Least Recently Used Caching strategy. 

Two types of data structure were used to provide local data stroage for the cached items. A hash map in the form of python dictionary was combined with a Doubly Linked List to implement the LRU cache. The dictionary is used to map every item in the cache to a specific location in the doubly linked list.
